Red Army|Satisfy your urge to jump up and down, cheer until your muscles ache and shout until your throat is Rensselaer red. Our primary purpose is to support RPI athletics by making sure student fans are heard loud and clear. The Red Army inspires students with pride in Rensselaer by promoting school spirit and energizing traditions. Greater involvement in all events and by all students on campus—especially at sporting events—is our mission. To create this kind of involvement the Red Army Committee utilizes its core competency of attracting students to attend the Engineers' and Red Hawks' games. We hope this is the beginning to a long standing tradition at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
