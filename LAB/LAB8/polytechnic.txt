Polytechnic|The Polytechnic has been serving the RPI community since 1885 as the student-run newspaper. We are self-funded through our advertisement department. Our news, sports, and features sections are always looking for people to cover events on campus, and we also could use people interested in helping with the production of the paper (proofing stories, laying pages out, etc.). We have our own server (on which we also maintain our webpage) and many computers for use in production. We also have a photography department with several cameras (including a Nikon D100) available for use in production of the paper. E-mail poly@rpi.edu with any questions.
