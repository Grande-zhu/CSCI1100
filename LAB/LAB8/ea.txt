Engineering Ambassadors|RPI Engineering Ambassadors (EA) program is managed through the School of Engineering – Educational Outreach Center. EAs are an assembly of highly motivated students that are focused on inspiring a younger audience to explore the role of engineers in society. We participate in an extensive communications and professional development training to learn the techniques that enable us to develop engaging presentations, hands-on demonstrations to take in to classrooms. EAs participate in 12 – 15 full day visits into regional middle and high school classrooms throughout the academic year and encourage over 3000 students to consider careers in the areas of science, technology and engineering.
Engineers Without Borders|Engineers Without Borders is an international humanitarian organization. We envision a world in which people have the means to meet their basic human necessities. Students collaborate with in country partners on community driven projects. EWB-RPI is one of 180 university chapters. Currently, students travel to Panama for project trips and all over the northeast U.S. for conferences.
