Quidditch Club|The purpose of this club is to utilize a real-life version of the sport of Quidditch from J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels in order to inspire students to lead more physically active and socially engaged lives. Quidditch is a game meant for all types of people, including those who have never read a single HP book. It's a mix of dodgeball, soccer, and rugby, and is the most fun you will ever have while getting in shape. We welcome people of all athletic abilities. This is a sport meant for those who want to have fun.
