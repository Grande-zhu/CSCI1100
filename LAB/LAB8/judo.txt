Judo Club|The RPI Judo Club provides a venue for members of the RPI community to engage in the study and practice of the martial art and sport of Judo. Judo is a martial art consisting of throws, pins, and grappling. It is a great workout as well as a disciplined martial art. We focus on self defense as well as competitive sport, and are comprised of an extremely diverse sampling of the student body with varying degrees of skill and experience ranging from the complete beginner through to the highly advanced. Our current instructor is Sensei Terry Sharp (5th Degree Black Belt USA Judo; 3rd degree Black Belt Kodokan Certified. We practice Mon & Thurs from 8-10 upstairs in the Mueller Center!
