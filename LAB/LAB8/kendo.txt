Kendo|Kendo is the art of Japanese fencing derived from the ancient art of samurai swordsmanship. The RPI Kendo Club is student led and devotes much of its attention to beginners. So even if you've never done any martial arts before you will have a very enjoyable experience, and will learn quickly. For those who have experience, this will also be a good place to further your skills. New members are always welcome. Practice is held in the Mueller Center (2nd Floor) on Mon & Wed 6:30 to 8 PM.
